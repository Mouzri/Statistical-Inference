# Statistical-Inference
Coursera Project

## Part 1: Simulation Exercise Instructions
In this project we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. 
The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. We will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. 
Note that we will need to do a thousand simulations.

Illustration will be via simulation and associated explanatory and we will highlight the following:  
   1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.  
   2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.  
   3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
    
## Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
We're going to proceed as follow:
   1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
   2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
   3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.
   4. State conclusions.
